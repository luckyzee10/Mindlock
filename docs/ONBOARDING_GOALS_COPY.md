# Onboarding Goal-Setting Copy

### Context
After the user chooses their charity, we segue into the goal-setting step. The tone should stay motivating: highlight the time they can reclaim while reminding them unlocks cost money (with a portion donated).

## Recommended Copy
> "You spend about **X hours** on your phone each day—**X hours a week** you could spend living. Stay under your goal and keep your minutes free; go over and you'll unlock more time (with part going to your cause). How much time do you want to allow yourself this week?"

- **Display Hint:** Pre-fill X with the usage estimate gathered earlier.
- **Helper Text:** "You can adjust this anytime in Setup. We'll nudge you before you run out."
- **CTA:** Slider or quick buttons (1 hr/day, 2 hrs/day, Custom).

## Alternative Lines
- **Hopeful Reframe:** "That's X hours every week you could reclaim. Make a promise to yourself—set a weekly screen-time goal."
- **Charity Tie-In:** "Every minute you stay under your goal keeps you focused and saves your unlock donations for when you really need them."

### Microcopy Support
- **Confirmation Toast:** "Goal set! We'll help you stay on track."
